## Process
<details>
<summary> Analysis and visualisation  </summary>
    <br> - Brainstormed ideas for the application
    <br> - Created our problem statement and solution

</details>
<p>
</p>
<details>
<summary> Designing </summary>
    <br> - Began analysis work: Stakeholder analysis, user stories/research, risk matrix, high level solution diagram and devops architecture diagram
    <br> - Created low-fi wireframes using Figma
    <br> - Mapped out and agreed on the ERD
    <br> - Designed high-fi wireframes using Figma
    <br> - Agreed on the project work methodology and ways of working
    <br> - Began building the Trello board
</details>

<details>
<summary> Building frontend, backend and deloyment </summary>
    <br> - After confirming our assigned tasks, the building of backend began (API and databases)
    <br> - Finalised high-fi wireframes
    <br> - Development team was split into frontend and backend to allow both to be built simultaniously
    <br> - Early deployment of the application to mitigate risks and bugs
    <br> - Building of pipelines using Jenkins
    <br> - Created the assets needed for the application for webpage styling after the base frontend and page connections were in a strong position
    <br> - Testing on frontend and backend

## Wins & Challenges

### Wins
- 
- 
-

### Challenges & Solutions
- Difficulties with Cloud/DevOps, specifically getting the Jenkins pipeline to work (took longer than expected) ​

       Worked as a team while on call to debug​

- Connections between pages deemed tricker than expected and sometimes broke the system. ​

        Standdown sessions were scheduled at 3pm to account for extended runtime for debugging (as the whole team was available for support). In addition to that, it allowed the debugged to be less stressful. ​

- Merge conflicts which sometimes broke the application ​

        Worked as a team while the 'master' of the repo lead the changes​

- Unexpected events during the project meant that there were some occasions where the full team was not available​

        Sharing responsibilities amongst the team, reprioritising tasks and pushing certain tasks forward to avoid it becoming a blocker later down the road.


### Bugs
- Application would sometimes break after a merge which was resolved with team effort
